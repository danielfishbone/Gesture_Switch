step 1:

download raspberry Pi imager at https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
install it after downloading

Step 2:
 open imager  >> CHOOSE OS >> select your preferred OS  (i used raspbian buster with desktop environment )
Step 3:
plug in your SD card to your pc using the SD card Reader 

click on the CHOOSE STORAGE button and select your Sd card then click on write and wait to complete
Step 5:
insert the SC card into your pi and setup your basic profile 

Step 6:
open your terminal and run the following commands (not the ones in parenthesis) also exclude the dollar sign 

$ raspi-config  (this should open the config console on your raspberry pi)

>> go to interface options  and enable i2c 
>> you can also confihure your audio device to use HDMI or AUDIO jack


$ sudo apt-get update        (update your apt repo)
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev  ( install python )
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
$ sudo apt-get -y install i2c-tools python3-smbus python-smbus  (install i1c tools)


$ sudo apt-get install espeak          (text to speech engine)
$ sudo apt-get install espeak python-espeak (python binding for text to speech)
$ sudo python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall adafruit-blinka   (adafruit modules )
$ sudo i2cdetect -y 1   (this would detect the devices on the i2c bus )

$ git clone https://github.com/danielfishbone/Gesture_Switch.git   (this would get the whole project files into your home directory)
  
$ cd Gesture_Switch (go into project directory)

$ make              (compile library using make )
$ sudo python3 gesture.py (run and test the code )

**so if you've confirmed that everything works good we'll have to configure the pi to auto run the code 
at startup

$ sudo crontab -e

**tf this is the first time you're running the comand it'll ask you to choose your preferred editor
choose the number that points to the nano editor

then add the following line (**without quotes )to the end of the file 

"@reboot python3 /home/pi/Gesture_Switch/python/gesture.py"

press ctrl+s to save
press ctrl+x to exit
reboot your raspberry pi and test
